Assignment: Hello "Human".

Create an app that will show in the browser either a default value of "human" or the name provided in the URL query string. Please note, you may show simple text without any html formatting.

Optional Challenges:

As a bonus include a link to go back and make the message appear as in the wireframe as headings. Hint: If you are returning a string, your browser will still parse it as valid html if you have any html syntax in the string.
Can you include a "last_name" as a parameter and print out both the first and last names?
